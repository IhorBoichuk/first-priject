After going to that link, create a copy of the notebook either in your own account or locally. Once you complete the project and it passes the test (included at that link), submit your project link below. If you are submitting a Google Colaboratory link, make sure to turn on link sharing for "anyone with the link."

We are still developing the interactive instructional content for the machine learning curriculum. For now, you can go through the video challenges in this certification. You may also have to seek out additional learning resources, similar to what you would do when working on a real-world project.

For this challenge, you will complete the code to classify images of dogs and cats. You will use TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time. (Extra credit if you get it to 70% accuracy!)

Some of the code is given to you but some code you must fill in to complete this challenge. Read the instruction in each text cell so you will know what you have to do in each code cell.

The first code cell imports the required libraries. The second code cell downloads the data and sets key variables. The third cell is the first place you will write your own code.

The structure of the dataset files that are downloaded looks like this (You will notice that the test directory has no subdirectories and the images are not labeled):

cats_and_dogs
|__ train:
    |______ cats: [cat.0.jpg, cat.1.jpg ...]
    |______ dogs: [dog.0.jpg, dog.1.jpg ...]
|__ validation:
    |______ cats: [cat.2000.jpg, cat.2001.jpg ...]
    |______ dogs: [dog.2000.jpg, dog.2001.jpg ...]
|__ test: [1.jpg, 2.jpg ...]
You can tweak epochs and batch size if you like, but it is not required.
